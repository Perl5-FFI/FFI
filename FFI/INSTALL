
(1) Install the ffcall library, if you do not already have it installed.

If it is already installed, you will have, for example, an "avcall"
library, man page, and avcall.h header.  You can skip to step 2, and
if ffcall is not installed, you will be given an obvious error message.

ffcall is available from http://www.haible.de/bruno/packages-ffcall.html
and various other places.  Several platforms have their own distributions.

There is also a copy of ffcall in the ffcall subdirectory.  It is
known to work with FFI, but it may be old.  It is included only so you
have everything you need here, without searching.  But you may be
better off getting the current version.

   To use the version of ffcall in the ffcall subdirectory,
   see the README files there.  The basic process on Unix is

       cd ffcall-1.8
       ./configure
       make
       make check
       make install

   and on Windows it is

       cd ffcall-1.8
       nmake -f Makefile.msvc
       nmake -f Makefile.msvc check
       nmake -f Makefile.msvc install

   For platforms supported by the ffcall package, see ffcall/PLATFORMS


(2) Now, build the FFI package in the usual manner.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

See the pod documentation for details of usage.

Note that the test suite needs some work, to standardise it. Also, there are a
number of Win32-specific tests which should be extracted into a separate
file...
